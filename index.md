# Secure AI Framework

Secure machine learning has attracted a lot of interest the last few years. Thousands of academic papers have been written about 
about both attacking and defending ML. On the industry side, models have been deployed in adversarial settings for over a decade, and
the teams that manage those have learnt lessons, many of them non-public. With every deployment of AI it becomes more of a target. 

We want to bring all the sake holders together to talk about defense. AI is deployed in vastly different products, with vastly 
different threat models. Each has best practices, and we want to cross pollinate and figure out the most important universal lessons 
for new teams to follow. 

We also believe that there are open questions for academics that need to be solved before we can properly defend AI. The 
defense of ML against many classes of attacks seems impossible, but there may be alternate approaches from infosec that inspire 
new research.
